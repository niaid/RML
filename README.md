## Welcome to the RML GitHub Page

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/niaid/RML/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### website pages
[index.md](index.md) is our main homepage that publishes to [https://niaid.github.io/RML/](https://niaid.github.io/RML/) .  [schedule.md](schedule.md) has our schedule (I basically copied our poster).  You can edit these files or add other markdown files.  

### data/repos.yml

[_data/repos.yml](_data/repos.yml) has a listing of our repos for the training.  Originally, it was set up to automatically update based on the bcbb-training topic, but that seemed to mess other things up, so now it is just a manually made list.  **Please add your repo to this list.**  

You can add other data and bits to _data as well

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/niaid/RML/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.  You can also [configure other settings](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) in that file.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. Your markdown file should like the following:

```markdown
---
title: Title of page
layout: default ## either default or post - post is almost the same, it just automatically puts the title at the top of the page
anyothervariable: #you can add other page variables here see the Jekyll documentation ^^^
---

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text


```
